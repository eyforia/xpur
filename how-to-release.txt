1. build.gradle - change version to "-SNAPSHOT"
2. build locally

4. make sure build is passing https://travis-ci.org/github/eyforia/xpur
5. publish snapshot artifacts to maven central:

6. make sure snapshots are published successfully: https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;quick~xpur
7. verify signing keys are configured
	a. check installed secret keys:

		gpg --export-secret-keys >~/.gnupg/secring.gpg
	d. distribute public keys:
		gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-keys 1F7AEA93
